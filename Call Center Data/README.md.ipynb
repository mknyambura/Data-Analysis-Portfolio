    "This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, i will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, i will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in the call call center datase. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - NumPy\n",
    "> - pandas\n",
    "> - Matplotlib\n",
    "> - Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory data** visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanatory data** visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "In this first part, an exploratory data analysis will be conducted on the call center dataset using pythonand data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns, and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2 - Explanatory Data Visualization**\n",
    "Particularly, these sections are updated in this README.md file:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Dataset** \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains call records from different call centers. Our purpose is to explore the effective of each dataset based on their response time, reason of calling and the average of a calls among other features that we'll explore. The call center dataset contains 32,941 records and 12 features namely: \n",
    "    - id: The IDs of the customers\n",
    "    - customer_name: Names of the customers\n",
    "    - sentiment:\n",
    "            - Very Negative\n",
    "            - Negative\n",
    "            - Neutral\n",
    "            - Positive\n",
    "            - Very Positive\n",
    "    - csat_score: Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) measures customer satisfaction with a business, purchase, or interaction. It’s one of the most straightforward ways to measure customer satisfaction, and it's obtained by asking a simple question, such as 'How satisfied were you with your experience?' To answer, there's a corresponding survey scale, which can be 1 – 3, 1 – 5, or 1 – 10.\n",
    "    - call_timestamp: Days when the calls were made\n",
    "    - reason:\n",
    "            - Billing Question\n",
    "            - Service Outage\n",
    "            - Payments\n",
    "    - city\n",
    "    - state\n",
    "    - channel:\n",
    "            - Call Center\n",
    "            - Chatbot\n",
    "            - Email\n",
    "            - Web\n",
    "    - repsonse_time:\n",
    "            - Within SLA\n",
    "            - Below SLA\n",
    "            - Above SLA\n",
    "    - call duration in minutes\n",
    "    - call_center:\n",
    "            - Los Angeles/CA\n",
    "            - Baltimore/MD\n",
    "            - Denver/CO\n",
    "            - Chicago/IL\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Summary of Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that the call center that received most of the calls is Los Angeles/CA which contributed to  41.7% of the total calls received in the month of October, 2020. During the month of october, there are days that these call centers received the most calls. The prevailing day of the week that received most called is **Friday** having **day 21** of the month of October having the highest number of calls received (1170 calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four channels through which the customers made their calls/enquiries. The leading channel that was used by the customers is through the **call center** which contributes to 32.3% of the total calls received through the four channels. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, technology had a positive surge as well as people lost their jobs but despite this, it was expected that most calls should have been made through the chatbot or through Email bu customers preferred contacting the call centers directly. This is due to having the reason behind most calls recieved as **Billing Questions**. Billing Questions contributed to 62.6% of three reasons of the calls being made ***(Billing, Payments and Service Outage)***. This is more than half indicatng that most bills that were made wren't reflecting or weren't being serviced to the customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This explains why the highest sentiment recieved was Very Negative (26.6%) and Negative (33.6%). Having negavtive sentiments from your customers about your customer services is alarming. These neagtive sentiments contributed to 60.6%. The positive sentiments only contributed to 21.5% (Very Positive-9.6% and Positive-11.9%). This is alarming!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason that could have contributed to the high negative sentiments could be due to the SLA. In as much as we have most calls within SLA (62.6%) which is a positive sign, calls Above SLA have the least contribution (12.7%) while that Below SLA is 24.7% and that shouldn't be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "However that doesn't necessitate that correlation equates to causation of having negative sentiments and the Service Level Agreements. The negative sentiments could be completely related to the products offered by the institution and not the customer care services.\n",
    "\n",
    "These calls lasted between 10 to 40 minutes. 40 minutes is too long to resolve an issue by the respective call centers.\n"
